# In python operators are special symbols uesd to perform operations on variables/values.

# 1_Arithmatic operators 
# Uesd for mathematical operations
x = 2+3, 5 #(+)addition
x = 3-2, 1 #(-)subtraction
x = 4/2, 2 #(/)division
x = 3*3, 9 #(*)multiplication
x = 5%2, 1 #(%)modulus(reminder)
x = 2**3, 8 #(**)exponentiation(power)

# 2_Comparison(Relational) operators
# Compare two values
2 == 2, True #(==)equal to 
3 != 2, True #(!=)not equal to
3 > 2, True  #(>)greater than
3 < 2, False #(<)less thsn
3 >= 2, True #(>=)greater than or equal to
4 <= 3, False #(<=)less than or equal to 

# 3_Logical operators
# Uesd to combine conditional statment
(5>3 and 6>5), True #(and)True if both are True
(5<3 or 3<2), False #(or)True if one is True
not(5>3), False     #(not)Reverses the result
